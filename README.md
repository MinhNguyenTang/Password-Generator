# Password Generator in Symfony
### 
How to launch?

####
#####
    git clone https://github.com/MinhNguyenTang/Password-Generator.git

####
  Locate the repository you cloned in the terminal of your code editor:
#####
    cd PATH/To-the-project

###
    Before launching the app, make sure you have installed [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). I consider that you already have set PHP and all other stuff. 
####
  Still on the terminal, type:
#####
    symfony server:start
    symfony serve
    symfony serve -d

####
  These 3 command lines are equivalent to run the project.

####
  Then, type:
#####
  npm install
  npm run build
